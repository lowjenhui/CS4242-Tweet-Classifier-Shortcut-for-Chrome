Chrome Tweet-Classify Extension
======
Last updated: 20th Jan (Hopefully the TA doesn't change the pages :O)


Hello! This script is meant to be used for classifying tweets on http://evil-git.com:5000/ (because 600 tweets is really alot) and all that scrolling & clicking requires too many steps :x

Currently the keys are set to do the following actions on keydown:
	1: set sentiment to "positive" and submit form
	2: set sentiment to "neutral" and submit form
	3: set sentiment to "negative" and submit form
	4: set sentiment to "sensitive" and submit form
	
	c: opens a dialog box that allows you to copy the twitter link (I kinda have to ask my friends most of the time, honestly I think a computer would be better than me at classifying sentiments zzz)
	o: opens up twitter link (Images can get cut/want to check more info about the person who posted the tweet)

Oh~ and this only works on Chrome :)
Poke me on facebook if you need any help with this.
Have fun~
